# APL Token Standard

The APL token standard is Arch Network's native token standard, inspired by but distinct from Solana's SPL Token standard. It provides a robust foundation for creating and managing fungible tokens on the Arch blockchain.

## Overview

APL tokens are fungible tokens that can be created, transferred, and managed on the Arch blockchain. The standard supports features like:

- Minting new tokens
- Transferring tokens between accounts
- Delegated transfers
- Account freezing
- Multisignature authorities

## Core Components

### Mint

The Mint is the central authority and source of a token. It contains:

- `mint_authority`: Optional authority used to mint new tokens
- `supply`: Total supply of tokens
- `decimals`: Number of base 10 digits to the right of the decimal place
- `freeze_authority`: Optional authority to freeze token accounts

### Token Account

Each token holder has a Token Account that tracks their balance and permissions:

- `mint`: The mint this account is associated with
- `owner`: The owner of this account
- `amount`: The amount of tokens this account holds
- `delegate`: Optional delegate who can transfer tokens
- `state`: Account state (Uninitialized/Initialized/Frozen)
- `delegated_amount`: The amount delegated to the delegate
- `close_authority`: Optional authority to close the account

### Multisignature Support

The standard supports multisignature authorities with:
- Configurable number of required signers (M of N)
- Up to 11 signers per multisig
- Can be used for any authority role (mint, freeze, owner, etc.)

## Instructions

### Token Creation and Management
- `InitializeMint`: Create a new token type
- `InitializeAccount`: Create a new token account
- `InitializeMultisig`: Set up a multisignature authority
- `MintTo`: Create new tokens
- `Burn`: Destroy tokens
- `CloseAccount`: Close a token account

### Transfer and Delegation
- `Transfer`: Move tokens between accounts
- `Approve`: Delegate transfer authority
- `Revoke`: Remove delegation
- `TransferChecked`: Transfer with decimal verification
- `ApproveChecked`: Delegate with decimal verification

### Account Management
- `FreezeAccount`: Freeze an account
- `ThawAccount`: Unfreeze an account
- `SetAuthority`: Change various authority types

## Error Handling

The standard includes comprehensive error handling for common scenarios:

- Insufficient funds
- Invalid mint associations
- Authority mismatches
- State validation
- Overflow protection
- Frozen account operations
- Decimal mismatches

## Integration Guidelines

When integrating with the APL token standard:

1. **Account Creation**
   - Always create accounts through the system program first
   - Initialize them immediately to prevent front-running
   - Ensure rent-exempt balance requirements are met

2. **Authority Management**
   - Carefully manage mint and freeze authorities
   - Consider using multisig for sensitive operations
   - Properly handle authority transfers

3. **Token Operations**
   - Use checked variants of instructions when possible
   - Verify decimal places match expectations
   - Handle frozen accounts appropriately

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for all token operations
   - Validate account states before operations
   - Check for sufficient balances

## Differences from SPL Token

While inspired by the SPL Token standard, APL tokens have some key differences:

- Native to the Arch blockchain
- Different program ID and validation
- Arch-specific security considerations
- Platform-specific optimizations

## Security Considerations

When implementing APL tokens:

1. **Authority Control**
   - Carefully manage mint and freeze authorities
   - Consider using multisig for sensitive operations
   - Have clear authority transfer procedures

2. **Account Validation**
   - Always verify account ownership
   - Check account states before operations
   - Validate mint associations

3. **Operation Safety**
   - Use checked variants when possible
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Consider decimal place handling

4. **Front-running Protection**
   - Initialize accounts immediately after creation
   - Use atomic operations when possible
   - Implement proper authorization checks
