# Basics

Now that we've successfully compiled a program and executed it within the context of our Arch VM, let's dig into the details of how an Arch [program] is written and discuss some best practices.

In this section, we'll guide you through the basics of writing functions and handling input parameters effectively within the example program that we worked with in the previous section: [GraffitiWall].
