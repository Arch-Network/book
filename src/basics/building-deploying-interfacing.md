# Building, deploying and interfacing

Now that all of the dependencies are installed and we have successfully chosen a [development stack], we can finally discuss program development, including compiling, deploying and interacting with it.

The `arch-cli` comes with a demo dapp called [GraffitiWall]; each message written to the wall contains a timestamp, name and note.

Find the program's logic within the `app/program/src/lib.rs ` file.

### Build
In order to compile the program, we'll make use of the `cargo-build-sbf` a binary, a tool that comes with the [Solana-CLI] that installs the toolchain needed to produce Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files which consist of [eBPF] bytecode.

Access the `app/program/src` folder:
```bash
cd app/program/src
```

Build the program
```bash
cargo-build-sbf
```

You will find the generated shared object file at: `./target/deploy/arch_network_app.so`

_If you are experiencing issues with this step, we recommend returning to review the [requirements] page or hopping in our [Discord dev-chat] channel for support._

### Deploy
In this step, we will be submitting a transaction to store our program's logic on the Arch Network.

> ps: make sure you have arch validator running before deploying the program, if you don't run `arch-cli validator start`

```bash
arch-cli deploy
```

Output:

  ```

Copy the Program ID from the output as you will need this again later. 

The Program ID can be thought of as a uniform resource locator (URL) for your deployed program on the Arch Network.

### Create an Account
An account is used to store the state for your dapp.

Obtain the Program ID from the deployment step output and use it within this command.

```bash
arch-cli account create --name graffiti --program-id <program-id>
```

### Start the demo application
```bash
arch-cli demo start
```
