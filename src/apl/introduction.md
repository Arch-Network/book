# Introduction to the Arch Program Library (APL)

The Arch Program Library (APL) is a collection of on-chain programs targeting the Arch Network blockchain. These programs serve as fundamental building blocks for developing decentralized applications (dApps) on Arch Network. The APL programs are thoroughly tested, audited, and deployed to the mainnet, providing developers with reliable and secure components for their applications.

## Available Programs

The APL currently includes the following core programs:

### Token Program
The foundation for creating and managing fungible tokens on Arch Network. It provides a robust implementation for:
- Token creation and management
- Account management
- Transfer operations
- Delegation capabilities
- Multisignature support

### Associated Token Account Program
A program that standardizes the creation and management of token accounts:
- Deterministic account address derivation
- Simplified account management
- Reduced transaction complexity

## Design Philosophy

The APL is designed with the following principles:

1. **Security First**
   - Comprehensive security audits
   - Battle-tested implementations
   - Conservative upgrade approach

2. **Composability**
   - Programs designed to work together
   - Standardized interfaces
   - Clear dependencies

3. **Performance**
   - Optimized for Arch Network's architecture
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Scalable implementations

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear documentation
   - Example implementations
   - Testing utilities

## Getting Started

To start building with APL:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [Arch Network architecture](../concepts/architecture.md)
2. Review the documentation for your program of interest
3. Check out the example implementations
4. Use the testing utilities to validate your integration

## Contributing

The APL is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the community. To contribute:

1. Review the contribution guidelines
2. Join the developer community
3. Submit proposals for new features
4. Help improve documentation
5. Report and fix bugs

## Support
