# Welcome to Arch Network

## What is Arch Network?
Arch Network is a computation environment that enhances Bitcoin's capabilities by enabling complex operations on Bitcoin UTXOs through its specialized virtual machine. Unlike Layer 2 solutions, Arch Network provides a native computation layer that works directly with Bitcoin's security model.

### Key Features
- **Bitcoin-Native**: Direct integration with Bitcoin's UTXO model
- **Computation Environment**: Execute complex programs within the Arch VM
- **Program Development**: Write programs in Rust to interact with Bitcoin UTXOs
- **Security**: Leverages Bitcoin's proven security guarantees
- **Developer Tools**: Complete development environment with CLI tools and explorer

## Core Architecture

### How Arch Works
Arch Network consists of three main components:

1. **Network Layer**
   - [Network Architecture](concepts/network-architecture.md): Distributed validator network
   - Node types: Bootnode, Leader, and Validators
   - Consensus and coordination

2. **Bitcoin Integration**
   - [Direct UTXO Management](concepts/bitcoin-integration.md)
   - Multi-signature operations
   - State anchoring to Bitcoin

3. **Computation Layer**
   - [Arch VM](concepts/architecture.md): eBPF-based execution environment
   - [Programs](program/program.md): Smart contract development
   - [Instructions](program/instructions-and-messages.md): Transaction processing
