# Welcome to Arch Network

## What is Arch Network?
Arch Network is a computation environment that enhances Bitcoin's capabilities by enabling complex operations on Bitcoin UTXOs through its specialized virtual machine. Unlike Layer 2 solutions, Arch Network provides a native computation layer that works directly with Bitcoin's security model.

### Key Features
- **Bitcoin-Native**: Direct integration with Bitcoin's UTXO model
- **Computation Environment**: Execute complex programs within the Arch VM
- **Program Development**: Write programs in Rust to interact with Bitcoin UTXOs
- **Security**: Leverages Bitcoin's proven security guarantees
- **Developer Tools**: Complete development environment with CLI tools and explorer

## Choose Your Path 

### ðŸš€ Quick Start (15 minutes)
Build your first Arch program:
1. Set up your development environment

## Core Architecture

### How Arch Works
Arch Network consists of three main components:

1. **Arch VM**: Executes programs and manages computation
2. **Bitcoin Integration**: Direct UTXO interaction and management
3. **Validator Network**: Ensures program execution integrity
