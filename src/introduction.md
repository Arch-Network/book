# Introduction

Welcome to the Arch Network developer documentation.

This book will guide you through installation of Arch's developer stack as well as provide you with the essential knowledge to create, deploy and interact with Arch programs.

Arch Network leverages the security and ubiquity of [Bitcoin] to enhance decentralized applications by providing a computation environment. Arch facilitates complex operations on Bitcoin [UTXOs] through programs executed within the Arch VM environment.

### Prerequirements

#### Rust
This book explores Arch Network's programs. It is not a [Rust] tutorial, and it assumes basic Rust knowledge. It is strongly recommended to understand the language first before proceeding. 

#### Bitcoin
Additionally, it is helpful to understand how Bitcoin works, especially the UTXO model. A good resource is [Saylor Academy's Bitcoin for Developers course] as well as [Mastering Bitcoin] by [Andreas Antonopoulos].
